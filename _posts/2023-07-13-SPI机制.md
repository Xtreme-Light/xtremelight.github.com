## Service Provider Interface

服务提供接口

通过定义服务接口（一般是接口或者抽象类），获取任意jar中提供的实现类

原生java中的`java.util.ServiceLoader`，可以看到如下说明（jdk17）：

> ## Deploying service providers on the class path
> A service provider that is packaged as a JAR file for the class path is identified by placing a provider-configuration file in the resource directory `META-INF/services`. The name of the provider-configuration file is the fully qualified binary name of the service. The provider-configuration file contains a list of fully qualified binary names of service providers, one per line.
> For example, suppose the service provider com.example.impl.StandardCodecs is packaged in a JAR file for the class path. The JAR file will contain a provider-configuration file named:
> `META-INF/services/com.example.CodecFactory`
> that contains the line:
> `com.example.impl.StandardCodecs # Standard codecs`
> The provider-configuration file must be encoded in UTF-8. Space and tab characters surrounding each service provider's name, as well as blank lines, are ignored. The comment character is '#' ( U+0023 NUMBER SIGN); on each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored. If a service provider class name is listed more than once in a provider-configuration file then the duplicate is ignored. If a service provider class is named in more than one configuration file then the duplicate is ignored.
> A service provider that is mentioned in a provider-configuration file may be located in the same JAR file as the provider-configuration file or in a different JAR file. The service provider must be visible from the class loader that is initially queried to locate the provider-configuration file; this is not necessarily the class loader which ultimately locates the provider-configuration file.

通过在资源特定目录（`META-INF/services`)下创建以服务全限定类名（`com.example.CodecFactory`）为文件名字的文件来加载服务提供商。

文件的内容是服务提供者的完整类名（`com.example.impl.StandardCodecs`）可以有多个，每行一个

通过阅读类上的说明可以知道：内容主要是介绍SPI和如何使用SPI，最后说到了并发支持（当然是不支持），异常处理，null处理等。

SPI通过实现`java.lang.Iterable`迭代器接口，来遍历获取服务商，同时，服务商的加载也是基于hasNext()的懒加载。
